## Description

This repository contains the code used to conduct the computational experiments described in the paper *Spatial branch-and-bound for nonconvex separable piecewise-linear optimization*.

In our experiments we generated random instances of (i) network flow and (ii) knapsack problems with piecewise-linear functions (PLFs) in the objective. The code to generate those random instances can be found in *instance_generation.py*. 

We compare the following methods to solve those random instances:
 - our sBB algorithm in *sBB_main.py*, which uses auxiliary functions from *sBB_functions.py*.
 - Gurobi's built-in MINLP and PLF-MILP solver in *gurobi_solver.py*.
 - the toolbox [PiecewiseLinearOpt.jl](https://github.com/jump-dev/PiecewiseLinearOpt.jl) which convets a PLF to a logarithmic MILP model which we then solve by Gurobi's MILP solver in *Julia-MIP/MIP_solver.jl*.


## Replication



To replicate our experiments, proceed as follows:
- Experiment I: Network flow problems with continuous concave PLFs (Table 1). Run code in *main.py* and set parameter "problem" to "network flow".
- Experiment II: Knapsack problems with continuous non-concave PLFs (Table 3).  Run code in *main.py* and set parameter "problem" to "knapsack".
- Experiment III: Knapsack problems with continuous concave PLFs (Table 5). Run code in *main.py* and set parameter "problem" to "concave-knapsack".
- Experiment IV: Network flow problems with discontinuous l.s.c. PLFs (Table 7). Run code in *main.py* and set parameter "problem" to "discontinuous network flow".
- Experiment V: Knapsack problems with smooth nonlinear functions approximated by PLFs (Comparison with global solvers, Table 8). Run code in *main.py* and set parameter "problem" to "global-knapsack".
- Experiment VI: Improvement of solution quality by refinemnet of PLF approximation to smooth nonlinear function (Table 4). Run code in *main_approximation.py*.

After running the code, the results can be found as CSV files in *Julia-MIP/results*.
